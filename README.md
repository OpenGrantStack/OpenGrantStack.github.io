# OpenGrantStack.github.io
 GrantReady-Docs

· Purpose: Repository for grant templates, compliance frameworks, and schemas.
· README Quality: Good. Clearly explains purpose, audience, and structure.
· Gaps:
  · Missing Docs: The docs/, templates/, and schemas/ directories appear to be the core content. Need verification that they are populated.
  · Missing CI/CD: Has a pages.yml workflow for GitHub Pages. Good.
  · Missing Tests: No validation tests for JSON schemas or template integrity.
  · Missing API References: Not applicable.
  · Missing Diagrams: No diagrams explaining schema relationships or compliance frameworks.
· Recommendation: Implement CI to validate JSON/YAML schemas. Use a static site generator (e.g., MkDocs) to publish a professional documentation site from the docs/ folder.
